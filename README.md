major states affected in United States and have also created a dashboard to visualize the trends in
different covid cases and forecasted the trend for the dates from 17th March 2020 to 28th March
2020 of deaths happening across few predominant countries under limelight. Further we have used
Logistic Model and Random Forests in R to predict the number of deaths. We have used k-fold
